# Predicting-Loan-Payback

Loan lending is a core service provided by banks and financial institutions. However, not all borrowers repay their loans on time, which leads to financial losses. To reduce this risk, banks need a reliable system that can predict whether a customer is likely to repay a loan or default.

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model that predicts loan payback behavior using customer financial and demographic data.
